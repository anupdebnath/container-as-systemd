# Container Systemd Service Configuration Script (run.sh)

This script automates the process of configuring a container to start automatically as a systemd service. It uses Podman to manage containers and systemd to manage the service.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script (`run.sh`) is located.

3. Make the script executable if it's not already:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```
